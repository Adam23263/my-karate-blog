# Naha-te 「那覇手」
---
 &emsp; Naha the current capital of the island of Okinawa and an old commerical city of the Ryukyu Kingdom is the home of one of the three main locations of karate foundation.  Being a port city and a trading hub with china its apparent that Naha-te had a fair amount of Chinese influence in the style, one person involved in this integration was Ryu Ryu Ko who was a Chinese Martial artist from the 19th century, it's worth noting there are a few names for Ryu Ryu Ko due to Chinese politics and the aristocracy leading to them hiding their identities and other factors that mean the true identity of Ryu Ryu Ko is disputed. Ryu Ryu Ko is believed to have taught a few notable names in karate history, largely Higaonna Kanryō 「東恩納 寛量」aswell as Arakaki Seishō 「新垣 世璋」and Norisato Nakaima.

 &emsp; It was Higaonna Kanryō that study under Ryu Ryu Ko, and Arakaki that went on to have his specific style of te to being coined Naha-te, he himself then went on to teach even more notable students like Chōjun Miyagi 「宮城 長順」the founder of Goju-ryu as well as Mabuni Kenwa who also studied in Shuri-te then formed Shito-ryu.

 &emsp; Along with Higaonna, there was Norisato(Kenri) of the Okinawan Nakaima family that studied under Ryu Ryu Ko. Nakaima brought back his teachings to his family, and like many styles back in this era stayed in the family as a family style and was tough down the generations until it when on to form Ryūei-ryū.  

&emsp; Just like Nakaima family there was also another major family in Naha, the Kogusuku (Kojo) family, one of the descendent families of the original 'thirty six families' of chinese immigrants. The Kogusuku family passed there style of karate down six generations of descendants until coming to the world as Kojo-ryu, However there is ambiguity to the validity of the style being taught and its relation to the original family teachings.
