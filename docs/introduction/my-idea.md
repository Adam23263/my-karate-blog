<h1> My Idea </h1>
<h2> So what is my intention with this website? </h2>

&emsp; For me karate is more than a just sport or a hobby, it's a way for people to improve themselves both physically and mentally. I have currently trained karate in three countries at the point of writing this, and it as brought my together with people from the community and i want to give back too it.

&emsp; Using this website i want to share my thoughts and opinions on what i have learnt whilst training and researching karate over the years. I will be looking into the concepts, principles and the history.
