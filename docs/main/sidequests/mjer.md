&emsp; Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū also known as just Eishin-ryū is the oldest and most traditional line of Iaido, with claims of an unbroken lineage dating back to early 1600's when Iaido was founded by a samurai with the name of Hayashizaki Jinsuke Minamoto no Shigenobu, until the 20th century and the 17th sōke Ōe Masaji, the modern father of Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū school of Iaido 

&emsp; Ōe Masaji was one of the most important sōke of MJER under his lead, the school reduced its waza from 160 and organised the remanding ones into the current categories. He then went on to brand the school as Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū and had a more open approach to teaching leading to many branches of the school being formed. 

&emsp; Following on from the 17th sōke, the next notable one was the 20th Kōno Hyakuren, who by some is considered as the last uncontested sōke of MJER. Kōno is credited for adding two extra sets of waza called Dai Nippon Battō Hō, which are evolved from existing techniques and are taught from the standing position.
