&emsp; As like all martial arts there are many schools with many lineages, however there are 5 main schools.


There are many different styles of Iaido, each with its own approach to the art. Some of the most well-known styles include:

1. Muso Shinden Ryu: This is one of the most popular and widely practiced styles of Iaido. It was developed in the early 20th century by Nakayama Hakudo, and emphasizes fluid movements, precise cuts, and a focus on practical techniques.

2. Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu: This is one of the oldest and most traditional styles of Iaido, with roots dating back to the 16th century. It emphasizes a strong foundation in basic techniques, and places a high value on the development of ki (internal energy).

3. Seitei Iaido: This is a modern style of Iaido that was developed in the mid-20th century by the All Japan Kendo Federation. It is designed to standardize the practice of Iaido and make it more accessible to a wider audience.

4. Tamiya Ryu: This style of Iaido is known for its emphasis on speed and fluidity, and is characterized by its use of short, fast cuts.

5. Hoki Ryu: This is a rare and ancient style of Iaido that has been passed down through a single family for over 400 years. It is known for its use of complex and intricate techniques, and for its focus on the spiritual and philosophical aspects of the art.
