&emsp; So here we are on a karate page where we get distracted and start doing side quests and exploring other martial arts. I have recently taken up practising Iaido.  Iaido is a sword art with its routes in old samurai teachings of feudal Japan and has its roots in schools dating back to the 16th century, with the founder Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shingenobu developing a new swordsmanship that focused on the smooth quick drawing of the sword. 

&emsp; Iaido consists of three kanji 居'i' meaning to be present,　合'ai' meaning to come together,　and 道'do' meaning way. Therefore Iaido can mean the way of being present and one with the sword. As opposed to Kendo, the other more know sword art, Iaido's focus more on the smooth fluid movement of the the sword, prioritising technique over strength and placing emphasise on mindfulness, discipline and precision, it is as such seen as a form of meditation.
