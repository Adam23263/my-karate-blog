&emsp; As a basic Karate is a martial art that comes from the east Asian island county of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Modern-day karate is present worldwide and spread out over many styles and schools all with their own principles and takes upon the art. 

&emsp; In Karate there exits three main elements; Kihon 「基本」(basics), Kata 「型」(forms) and Kumite 「組手」(sparring) the three k's as such. These incorporate a combination of strikes, kicks, blocks, and stances. As a whole karate is an upright striking art with the aim of remaining standing, in comparison to a groundwork orientated style such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, however some schools do include throws and groundwork into their teachings. 

&emsp; However, karate is more than just a combination of techniques, it is a method of self-development as it is more than a sport, it is a martial art. It teaches discipline, respect, and control, it will show what your body and mind are capable of. It is an activity suitable for everyone as it only trains personal improvement. 

&emsp; The word Karate-do in Japanese consists of three characters or kanji, 空：kara (empty), 手：te (hand), 道：do (way). Together we get the way of the empty hand, and this put into principle the main intent of karate, which is to be able to defend oneself using nothing but unarmed techniques.
