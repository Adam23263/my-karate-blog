&emsp; Physics is the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behaviour through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. So of course it goes without saying that it is obviously has an impact on karate, most importantly how to generate force and power.  Without trying to get into writing a physics paper we can explore these principles and try to understand how they can influence our training.

&emsp; We can explore;

- [Impact force and momentum](/coming-soon) **(coming soon)**
- [Circles and the power of them](/coming-soon) **(coming soon)**
- [Triangles and their importance](/coming-soon) **(coming soon)**
- [Pressure](/coming-soon) **(coming soon)**
- [How can we utilise this knowledge](/coming-soon) **(coming soon)**
