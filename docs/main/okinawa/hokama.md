# Hokama Sensei

 &emsp; Tetsuhiro Hokama Sensei, Hanshi 10th Dan and chairman of Kenshikai Goju-ryu. Hokama Sensei is a master of "pain areas" learnt from the bubishi "the karate bible" and focusing on rediscovering the roots of traditional karate.

 &emsp; In our session at Hokamas Dojo we covered various applications of the kata Sanseru followed by some joint locks and take downs followed by a nunchucks session (fortunately undocumented) 

 ### Sanseru 

 1) The opening sequence to this kata has many functional interpretations, the one we covered was focusing on applying speed and technique to a punch followed by an immediate block.

 2) The next section was shown as an escape from wrist grab, using the gedan barai as a strike to the "pain area" on the wrist joint followed by a strike.   

 3) After the gedan barai we looked at the following technique and used it as a take down. The scooping hand(right) was to seize the heel with the base of the hand low to the floor whilst dropping low to the ground with your knee, taking the left hand to their knee and driving it down to the grown as raising the heel up. Hokama special is the place your big toe into the thigh as pulling the little toe whilst saying "enjoy, enjoy"

 4) A jumping kick can by applied in many ways, however nothing beats just flying at a mugger with a jumping kick... Also i forgot what i was shown...

 5) The next sequence of repeated moves has a few applications, the own shown was a take down/throw. It was initiated from a a mutual collar grip, then kicking the lead leg on the inwards sweep whilst appling a up down rotation with the arms using body weight throwing the person in the direction of the sweep, ie. following a circle movement.

 
 6) Following on from the leg sweep we reach the the section with downwards cross strike, Hokama Sensei taught this as a escape from a belt grab. Two variant were shown to us, the first dropping your body weight with your arms crossed striking the "pain area" then grabbing the collar in a cross choke rotating them to the ground. The second sticking outwards attacking the same area the grasping the face when rotating to the ground.

 7) A simple yet affective use of the last moves in the kata was to defend against a high front kick. A simple catch of the leg stepping to the outside and with a push pull throw to the floor, simple yet effective.

 8) The final move in this kata with the very flowy hand moves has many ideas for it ranging from the obvious to the bonkers. The own shown at the dojo was a wrist lock form a hand grab with a complex way to describe so we just have the video.

 ### Wrist Locks

 &emsp; After finishing the kata bunkai we moved on to looking at some simple wrist locks and take downs.

 1) Nice to Meet you, as it was introduced starts from a normal handshake then with a change in grip to a "broshake" we collapsed the elbow retaining for control with our free hand whilst bringing our elbow to the jaw, then drawing the elbow into, down and through the chest in a crescent moon shape to brake the balance we twist out self in a full smooth circle throwing them to the ground, all whats retaining the pressure on the wrist.

 2) Another simple version of Nice to Meet you is after taking the "broshake" position is to apply firm pressure back on to the thumb driving the person to the floor.

 3) We also covered an option of what do to when faced with a basic shoving attack. The response was to take a chance and grasp the hand when coming in, taking the pinky finger and guiding the person to the floor.

 4) The final technique we covered was an escape from having both your wrists held. What we did was utilise the hard soft body mechanics and circular movements to rotate and smash their wrist joints and take control over a single hand with opposite hand, appling rotational pressure to the wrist and collapsing in towards the person aiming to attack the eyes.
