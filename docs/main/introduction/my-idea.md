<h1> My Idea </h1>
<h2> So what is my intention with this website? </h2>

&emsp; For me karate is more than just a sport or a hobby, it is a way for people to improve themselves both physically and mentally. I have currently trained in karate in four countries at the point of writing this, and it has brought me together with people from the community and I want to give back to it. 

&emsp; Using this website, I want to share my thoughts and opinions on what I have learnt whilst training and researching karate over the years. I will be looking into the concepts, principles, and history... among other things along the way.
