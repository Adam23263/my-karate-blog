# About Me
---
&emsp; First things first, I am the first person to say I am by no means an expert in karate, I am just a simple practitioner with too much spare time on my hands. 

&emsp; I have actively trained in karate now for over 10 years, with my main background being in a school which teaches the joined principles of Gōjū-ryū and Shotokan under one style with a predominantly traditional ideology. I have also trained in sports karate by way of a Shotokan school and contact karate by way of Kyokushin.
