&emsp; Previously we looked at the roots of karate as a whole and followed them back down to the island of Okinawa and the original style called Tōde. However there's more than just one style of karate as we know, so where did these come from and who's responsible for their founding?

&emsp; Currently there are over 75 different styles out there, the most notable are Shotokan, Goju-ryu, Shito-ryo and Wado-ryu. There is also Kyukoshin karate a full contact form of the art. 

&emsp; How did we get to these styles from one old ancient style on a small island in a lost kingdom? lets have a look.

&emsp; If we start at Tōde and follow its notable masters and their students we can see how the modern style came to be.
