# Where did it come form?
---

&emsp; As we know Karate is a Japanese martial art, but there is a lot more to the history of Karate other than just coming from Japan. Japan consists of an archipelago of close to 7000 islands, and its current constitution only forming in 1947.

So where did it actually come from? The best way to discover this is to follow it teachings backwards in time. lets begin.

## Present day - Karate in the World

&emsp; In the present day Karate is an international sport with major establishments in all continents (excluding Antarctica for obvious reason), all united under the largest governing body the World Karate Federation. There have been world games is karate since 1981 and had its olympic debut in 2021.

&emsp; In the 1950s karate was brought to Europe around the by the masters, which then led to French karate federations, from there it spread out over Europe urging the creation of the European karate union in 1965, then quickly spreading internationally to form the international karate union in 1970.  

&emsp; So on the world theatre its considerably new, however prior to spreading out to the world form Japan it had to first come to Japan and this was done by *the father of modern karate* Gichin Funakoshi the founder of Shotokan karate.

&emsp; Gichin Funakoshi「船越義珍」is a major name in karate, he was notably famous for being responsible for bringing karate to Japan and founding Shotokan karate. Funakoshi moved to the Japanese mainland in 1922 where he coined the name *empty hand* or karate for the martial art in order to downplay any connection to China. It was Funakoshi that introduced karate into the school system and brought it to the attention of the public.

&emsp; It is now apparent how karate is shown as a Japanese art, as this is where it was shown to the world, however since Karate was brought to Japan in the 1920s... where was it brought from?
 
&emsp; If we continue to follow Funakoshi we can see where he brought it from. Although he died in Tokyo, Japan in 1957 he was born on the island of Okinawa which is one of the many island groups of the Japanese archipelago in 1868. Today Okinawa is a prefecture of Japan, but then it was an independent kingdom, the Ryukyu Kingdom from 1429 until it was annexed in 1879 by Japan.

&emsp; Where are we now then? Now we're in the the Ryukyu kingdom on the island of Okinawa in a time well before Funakoshi and long before the name *karate* existed, we're jumping back to the 18th century. 

&emsp; In the 18th century the Ryukyu kingdom is home to it's own martials arts that are growing in three main villages, Shuri, Naha and Tomari. These three villages are home the their respective martial art then called *te 「手」* giving us Shuri-te, Naha-te and Tomari-te. These collective schools were called Tōde 「唐手」(tang hand) which prior to the 18th century was still a single style, and its this style where we can trace the routes of karate back to. We can follow the routes of Tōde even further back and look into the history of Ryukyu kobudō and chinese kung fu which were combined to form it. However the Karate nerd has done a wonderful video series [which you can find here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnepTzrhzuB-6k93Klo0L5GDwiMym3Y9a) that does a great job at discovering this.

## What have we found out?

&emsp; We have traced down the tree of karate going from it being an international sport off today, to from it coming and leaving Japan, all the way back to Okinawa in the old Ryukyu kingdom. 

&emsp; To sum it up we can quickly follow it forward from when Chinese kung-fu came to the island. Kung-fu was combined with old Okinawan arts to form Tōde or Chinese hand, Tōde then split into the three te of the villages Shuri, Naha and Tomari, these then grew and developed into the modern karate styles which well look into later, leaving the villages, Tōde came to mainland Japan by Gichin Funakoshi and then coined karate to hide the chinese connection. And from Japan it quickly spread to the world.
