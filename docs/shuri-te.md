# Shuri-te 「首里手」
---

&emsp; Shuri is the ancient capital of Okinawa and the home of one Kanga Sakugawa 「佐久川 寛賀」who was a major figure in the formation of karate and a teacher to the founder of Shuri-te. Sakugawa trained under an Okinawan monk called Takahara Pechin 「高原 親雲上」, it was Takahara who suggested Sakugawa trained under Kusanku a Chinese martial artist. 

&emsp; Sakugawa Trained was the reluctant teacher of Sōkon Matsumura「松村 宗棍」who taught Matsumura for 5 year due to an agreement with his father. It was however Matsumura that then went on to found Shuri-te. 

&emsp; Looking at the students of Mastsumura we can see how after a few generations they went on to form modern styles, including Shotokan, shito-ryu and kobayashi shorin-ryu.
