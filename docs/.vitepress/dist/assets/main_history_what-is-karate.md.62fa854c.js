Modern day karate is present worldwide and spread out over many styles and schools all with their own principles and takes upon the art.</p><p>  In Karate there exits three main elements; Kihon 「基本」(basics), Kata 「型」(forms) and Kumite 「組手」(sparring) the three k&#39;s as such. These incorporate a combination of strikes, kicks, blocks and stances. As a whole karate is a upright striking art with the aim of remaining standing, in comparison to a groundwork orientated style such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, however some schools do include throws and groundwork into their teachings.</p><p>  However karate more than just a combination of techniques, is a method of self development as it&#39;s more than a sport, it&#39;s a martial art. It teaches discipline, respect and control, it will show what your body and mind are capable of. Its an activity suitable for everyone as it only trains personal improvement.</p><p>  The word Karate-do in Japanese consists if three characters or kanji, 空：kara (empty), 手：te (hand), 道：do (way). Together we get <em>The way of the empty hand</em> and this put into principle the main intent of karate, which it to be able to defend ones self using nothing but unarmed techniques.</p>',7),n=[o];function r(h,d,c,l,p,m){return t(),e("div",null,n)}const _=a(s,[["render",r]]);export{w as __pageData,_ as default};
