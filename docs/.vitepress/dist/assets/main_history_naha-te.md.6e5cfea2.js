Being a port city and a trading hub with china its apparent that Naha-te had a fair amount of Chinese influence in the style, one person involved in this integration was Ryu Ryu Ko who was a Chinese Martial artist from the 19th century, it&#39;s worth noting there are a few names for Ryu Ryu Ko due to Chinese politics and the aristocracy leading to them hiding their identities and other factors that mean the true identity of Ryu Ryu Ko is disputed. Ryu Ryu Ko is believed to have taught a few notable names in karate history, largely Kanryō Higaonna「東恩納 寛量」aswell as Seishō Arakaki 「新垣 世璋」and Norisato(Kenri) Nakaima.</p><p>  It was Kanryō Higaonna that study under Ryu Ryu Ko, and Arakaki that went on to have his specific style of te to being coined Naha-te, he himself then went on to teach even more notable students like Chōjun Miyagi 「宮城 長順」the founder of Goju-ryu as well as Mabuni Kenwa who also studied in Shuri-te then formed Shito-ryu.</p><p>  Along with Higaonna, there was Norisato of the Okinawan Nakaima family that studied under Ryu Ryu Ko. Norisato brought back his teachings to his family, and like many styles back in this era stayed in the family as a family style and was tough down the generations until it when on to form Ryūei-ryū.</p><p>  Just like Nakaima family there was also another major family in Naha, the Kogusuku (Kojo) family, one of the descendent families of the original &#39;thirty six families&#39; of chinese immigrants. The Kogusuku family passed there style of karate down six generations of descendants until coming to the world as Kojo-ryu, However there is ambiguity to the validity of the style being taught and its relation to the original family teachings.</p><p><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Okinawan_martial_arts#/Naha-te" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+n+'" alt="Naha-te Tree"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Okinawan_martial_arts#/Naha-te" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+o+'" alt="Kogusuku tree"></a></p>',8),h=[r];function l(d,u,m,f,y,c){return t(),e("div",null,h)}const w=a(s,[["render",l]]);export{p as __pageData,w as default};
