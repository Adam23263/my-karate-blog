# About Me
---
&emsp; First things first I am the first person to say I am by no means an expert in karate, im just a simple practitioner with a too much spare time on my hands. 

&emsp; I have activley trained karate now for over 10 years, with my main background being in a school which teaches the joined priniples of Gōjū-ryū and Shōtōkan under one style with a predominantly traditional ideology. I have also trained in sports karate by way of a Shōtōkan school and contact karate by way of Kyokushin.
