&emsp; As a basic Karate is martial art that comes form the east Asian island county of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Modern day karate is present worldwide and spread out over many styles and schools all with their own principles and takes upon the art.

&emsp; In Karate there exits three main eliments; Kihon 「基本」(basics), Kata 「型」(forms) and Kumite 「組手」(sparring) the three k's as such. These incorporate a combination of strikes, kicks, blocks and stances. As a whole karate is a upright art with the aim to remain standing, in comparison to a groundwork oritated style such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, however some schools do include throws and groundwork into their teachings.

&emsp; To me karate is a method of self development as it's more than a sport, it's a martial art. It teaches discipline, respect and control, it will show what your body and mind are capable of. Its an activity suitable for everyone as it only trains personal improvement.
