## So what is it?
> "karate is a lifetime study" - Kenwa Mabuni

&emsp; As a basic Karate is martial art that comes form the east Asian island county of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Modern day karate is present worldwide and spread out over many styles and schools all with their own principles and takes upon the art.

&emsp; In Karate there exits three main elements; Kihon 「基本」(basics), Kata 「型」(forms) and Kumite 「組手」(sparring) the three k's as such. These incorporate a combination of strikes, kicks, blocks and stances. As a whole karate is a upright striking art with the aim of remaining standing, in comparison to a groundwork orientated style such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, however some schools do include throws and groundwork into their teachings.

&emsp; However karate more than just a combination of techniques, is a method of self development as it's more than a sport, it's a martial art. It teaches discipline, respect and control, it will show what your body and mind are capable of. Its an activity suitable for everyone as it only trains personal improvement. 

&emsp; The word Karate-do in Japanese consists if three characters or kanji, 空：kara (empty), 手：te (hand), 道：do (way). Together we get *The way of the empty hand* and this put into principle the main intent of karate, which it to be able to defend ones self using nothing but unarmed techniques. 

## Where did it come form?

&emsp; As we know Karate is a Japanese martial art, but there is a lot more to the history of Karate other than just coming from Japan. Japan consists of an archipelago of close to 7000 islands, and its current constitution only forming in 1947.

So where did it actually come from? The best way to discover this is to follow it teachings backwards in time. So.. lets begin.

### Present day - Karate in the World

&emsp; In the present day Karate is an international sport with major establishments in all continents (excluding Antarctica for obvious reason), all united under the largest governing body the World Karate Federation. There have been world games is karate since 1981 and had its olympic debut in 2021.

&emsp; In the 1950s karate was brought to Europe around the by the masters, which then led to French karate federations, from there it spread out over Europe urging the creation of the European karate union in 1965, then quickly spreading internationally to form the international karate union in 1970.  

&emsp; So on the world theatre its considerably new, however prior to spreading out to the world form Japan it had to first come to Japan and this was done by *the father of modern karate* Gichin Funakoshi the founder of Shotokan karate.

### Coming to Japan - The Father Of Modern Karate

&emsp; Gichin Funakoshi「船越義珍」is a major name in karate, he was notably famous for being responsible for bringing karate to Japan and founding Shotokan karate. Funakoshi moved to the Japanese mainland in 1922 where he coined the name *empty hand* or karate for the martial art in order to downplay any connection to China. It was Funakoshi that introduced karate into the school system and brought it to the attention of the public.

&emsp; It is now apparent how karate is shown as a Japanese art, as this is where it was shown to the world, however since Karate was brought to Japan in the 1920s... where was it brought from?
 
&emsp; If we continue to follow Funakoshi we can see where he brought it from. Although he died in Tokyo, Japan in 1957 he was born on the island of Okinawa which is one of the many island groups of the Japanese archipelago in 1868. Today Okinawa is a prefecture of Japan, but then it was an independent kingdom, the Ryukyu Kingdom from 1429 until it was annexed in 1879 by Japan.

&emsp; Where are we now then? Now we're in the the Ryukyu kingdom on the island of Okinawa in a time well before Funakoshi and long before the name *karate* existed, we're jumping back to the 18th century.
